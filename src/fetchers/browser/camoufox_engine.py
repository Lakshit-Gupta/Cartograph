"""Camoufox-backed `BrowserEngine` implementation (Phase 1, the only impl).

Wraps `camoufox.async_api.AsyncCamoufox` with the same launch + per-context
cookie-jar pattern used by `src/fetchers/browser/camoufox.py` and the
apply-browser worker: ONE Firefox process held alive across many contexts,
each `open_context` minting a fresh isolated `BrowserContext` so identity
cookie jars never cross-contaminate.

Adds the lifecycle the discovery worker needs on top of the fetcher's pool:
`restart()` (drop the browser every N cycles to fight camoufox memory drift)
and `is_alive()` (probe before each combo, restart on IPC death).

camoufox is imported lazily inside the methods so importing this module costs
nothing at scaffold time and does not require camoufox on hosts that never
launch a browser (e.g. the Pi). Cookies arrive already in Playwright shape —
the worker converts the identity dict → list before calling — so they are
passed straight to `add_cookies` with NO re-conversion here.
